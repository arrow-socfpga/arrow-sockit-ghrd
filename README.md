# arrow-sockit-ghrd
Repository for Arrow SoCKit hardware reference designs

The Arrow SoCKit Development Kit GHRD, or Golden Hardware Reference Design, is based on the Intel PSG Cyclone V Development Kit GHRD found in <quartus_install_directory>/embedded/examples/hardware/cv_soc_devkit_ghrd.  This repository contains a "baseline" GHRD along with variations that add support for additional hardware features on the SoCKit or demonstrate other functionality of the SoC device.

The master branch contains only this README file and MIT LICENSE file.  Branches are used for GHRD variations and tools version updates following this naming convention:

sockit-ghrd-\<variation>-<quartus_version>

Each branch contains a README file describing the design in that branch.
